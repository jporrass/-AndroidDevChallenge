I would like to develop a kind of app which could recognize the license plate in the Street in movement. This app should be install in a kind of camera looking forward on the back of the rearview mirror. The app should recognizes the license plate and compares it with a list of maybe stolen cars, and could send a warning to the policy with the location of the car. People could receive a kind of reward for every warning send. This could be used in smartstreets too in the feture.
